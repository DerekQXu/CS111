# CS 111 - Operating Systems Principles
My solutions to the homeworks and projects for CS111 at UCLA - Operating Systems with
Prof. Kampe. These were posted to demonstrate the fundamental computer science concepts
learned in the class. Copying is strictly prohibited and will be at your own expense.

## Scores
**Labs:**
1A - 100, 1B - 100, 2A - 100, 2B - 95, 3A - 93, 3B - 100, 4A - 100, 4B - 90, 4C - 100

Error with 4B: I interpretted the specification incorrectly as I assumed that stop data parsing
meant only output not output AND logging. This was fixed in 4C's implementation.
